# Descriptive Statistics for Numeric Variables

In this repository we calculate summary statistics for a numerical variable. It is a part of a course on Computational Social Science.
The repository consist of:
- Python notebook
- Synthetic dataset (created in a previous repository)
- Synthetic survet

In this section, we will calculate and interpret key summary statistics for a numeric variable: **Age**. These statistics provide insights into the central tendency, variability, and overall distribution of the data.

### What We Will Cover
1. **Mean**: The average value, showing the central tendency of the data.
2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is sorted, representing the central point.
3. **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.
4. **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values, showing the spread.
5. **Variance**: The average squared deviation from the mean, measuring variability.
6. **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance from the mean.
7. **Percentiles**

### Why This Matters
- Summary statistics help us understand the data at a glance.
- They reveal patterns, such as whether the data is centered, widely spread, or skewed.
- These metrics are the foundation for more advanced statistical analysis.
