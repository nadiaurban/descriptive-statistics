    "# Descriptive Statistics for Numeric Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will calculate and interpret key summary statistics for a numeric variable: **Age**. These statistics provide insights into the central tendency, variability, and overall distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Will Cover\n",
    "1. **Mean**: The average value, showing the central tendency of the data.\n",
    "2. **Median**: The middle value when the data is sorted, representing the central point.\n",
    "3. **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset.\n",
    "4. **Range**: The difference between the maximum and minimum values, showing the spread.\n",
    "5. **Variance**: The average squared deviation from the mean, measuring variability.\n",
    "6. **Standard Deviation**: The square root of the variance, representing the average distance from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "- Summary statistics help us understand the data at a glance.\n",
    "- They reveal patterns, such as whether the data is centered, widely spread, or skewed.\n",
    "- These metrics are the foundation for more advanced statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable in Focus: **Age**\n",
    "We will explore the `Age` variable from our dataset, which represents the age of respondents in years. By calculating these statistics, we will learn how the ages are distributed across the sample and identify patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Expect\n",
    "- We will calculate the statistics using Python's `pandas` library.\n",
    "- We will visualize the distribution of the `Age` variable using a histogram for better understanding.\n",
    "- Interpretation of each statistic will be provided to connect the calculations to real-world insights.\n"

    "   - The total number of non-missing observations in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - The arithmetic average of the data values, representing the central tendency of the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation (std)**:\n",
    "   - Measures the dispersion or spread of the data. It indicates how much the individual data points deviate from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Minimum (min)**:\n",
    "   - The smallest value in the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **25th Percentile (25%)**:\n",
    "   - Also known as the first quartile (Q1), it represents the value below which 25% of the data lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **50th Percentile (50%)**:\n",
    "   - Also known as the median, it represents the middle value of the dataset when sorted.\n",

    "### Calculating Summary Statistics Individually\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `describe()` method provides a quick and comprehensive summary of the statistics for a numerical column, we can also calculate individual summary statistics separately for more detailed control over our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are calculating the following statistics for the `Age` variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean**:\n",
    "   - The average value of the `Age` column, calculated using `age.mean()`. This tells us the central tendency of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median**:\n",
    "   - The middle value of the `Age` column when sorted, calculated using `age.median()`. The median is less sensitive to outliers compared to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode**:\n",
    "   - The most frequently occurring value in the `Age` column, calculated using `age.mode()`. The `[0]` is used to extract the first mode when multiple modes exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Range**:\n",
    "   - The difference between the maximum and minimum values, calculated with `age.max() - age.min()`. The range gives us an idea of how spread out the values are.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Variance**:\n",
    "   - The average of the squared differences from the mean, calculated with `age.var()`. Variance measures the dispersion of the data and indicates how much individual values deviate from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "   - The square root of the variance, calculated using `age.std()`. Standard deviation is another measure of dispersion that is easier to interpret since it's in the same units as the data.\n",

    "- The **mean** is the average age of the respondents.\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: On average, the respondents are **49.86 years old**.\n",
    "- This value represents the central tendency of the dataset, showing where most data points cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2. **Median (50.0)**\n",

    "- **Interpretation**: Half of the respondents are younger than **50 years**, and half are older.\n",

    "- **Why Important?**:\n",

    "- The **range** is the difference between the maximum and minimum values.\n",
    "- Formula: \\( \\text{Range} = \\text{Max} - \\text{Min} \\).\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: The youngest respondent is **18 years old**, and the oldest is **79 years old**, resulting in a range of **61 years**.\n",

    "### 6. **Standard Deviation (18.11)**\n",
    "- The **standard deviation** is the square root of the variance and represents the average distance of each age from the mean.\n",

    "### Overall Insights:\n",
    "- The ages in this dataset are centered around 50 years, with most respondents being within 18 years of this average.\n",
